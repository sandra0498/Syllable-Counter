# Syllable Counter
 
 ~~~~~~~~
 These two python files share the same code that counts syllables
 syllables.py : intergrated GUI programming (tkinter module) 
 syllableCounter.py : simply prompts a question in the compiler and returns the amount of syllables 
 
 ~~~~~~~~~
**Both of these files were implemented with modular programming**
  >> Many of the rules were seperated into modules, instead of one long method executing all of the commands. 
  >> The files are commented explaining my thought process as to what I coded.
